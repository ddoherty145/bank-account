# **Bank Account Application**

This is my Bank Account Homework Assignment. I created a class can BanKAccount that has serveral attributes. Accounts are represted by full_name, account_number generates a random number, and balance is how to assign a set amount of money to an account. Within the class I defined functions that simulate the general functions of a ATM machine such as making a deposit, withdrawing money from an account, viewing the balance of an account, adding interest, and printing a full bank statement.

To Activate the Code:
`code` python3 bank_account.py
